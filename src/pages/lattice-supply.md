📷🎥 I have been taking photographs and making videos since the early 2000s. I most recently picked up a Sony alpha 6300 and fell in love with it again in 2019. I made photos for Lattice Supply for the development and marketing of the brand. I also enjoy catching a Kendall Street Company show when I can. I was lucky enough to take photos at the 9:30 Club in D.C. for them where I had first seen Reel Big Fish play in 2010. Thank you Louis, Brian, Ryan, Jake and, of course, Peaches for having me along for some of the ride before the pandemic.

I worked both LOCKN' Festival and Resonance festivals in 2019.

November 7th, 2020 is one of the few happy days I remember from this past year. On this day, every person I saw was wearing a smile on their face. Strangers waving, cheering, and honking at one another as the joyful news hit us all. The energy was different, the tides were changing, and a sense of normalcy was restored. Cars came flooding in from all directions, and those with signs like "I VOTED BLUE IN PA" and cutouts of Joe Biden's head are what really stuck out to me on this day (other than a man in a loincloth and an inner-tube running down Black Lives Matter Plaza in diving flippers). I was driving back from Great Falls Park, listening to WAMU, when I heard news for the first time. "President-Elect Joe Biden and Vice-President-Elect Kamala Harris" were one step closer to the White House. This photograph was taken that evening on the 1000 block of 16th street, just north of Black Lives Matter Plaza on the North side of the White House. To me, this captures a moment that truly shows the resiliency of the human spirit; it reflects how we were all feeling on that monumental day.
