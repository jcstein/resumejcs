🥬🧅 I learned to cook in Richmond, Virginia at the Daily Kitchen & Bar in Carytown. I also worked for the Pit and the Peel, helping develop a new menu for their franchising efforts and design the current kitchens to test and plan for the commercial kitchens in the James Center and in Short Pump Town Center.

I am passionate about reducing food waste and ensuring every person can eat the meals they need to survive. Currently, I am volunteering to help restore food security in the greater Boston, Massachusetts region with [Project Restore Us](https://projectrestoreus.org).
